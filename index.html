<h1>Mustache History</h1>
<h2>The History of Mustaches</h2>
<h3>Early History (Earth's creation - 1900)</h3>
<p>Mustaches have existed for almost as long as humans have. The first Homo Sapiens grew out mustaches to signal to their mates that they were fertile. In fact, early evidence suggests that Adam, the first man living, grew out a sweet mustache in his later years. His mustache-laden genes were passed from generation to generation, and even now, men with mustaches are traced as direct descendants of Adam. Many have speculated as to whether or not God had a mustache, but through vigorous research, historians have concluded that since Jesus had a beard and Jesus was God's son (or God himself in certain religions), God almost certainly had at least a pencil mustache that he shaved from time to time or a full beard.</p>
<h3>Modern History (1900 - present)</h3>
<p>After thousands of years of prestigious figures sporting mustaches, there came a dark age for the feathery plume of hair. Hipsters began <em>ironically</em> growing their own facial hair using testosterone supplements and vitality pills. The most famous of this era of weak men artificially growing mustaches reached its peak during World War II, where Fuhrer Adolf Hitler of Germany, General Secretary Joseph Stalin of the U.S.S.R., and Emperor Hirohito of Japan, all notorious hipsters, routinely took pills to maintain their weak mustaches, and thus keep their armies subservient to them. However, after World War II, foreign hipsters stopped donning mustaches and passed the hairy torch back to red-blooded American men.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict: Dumb or Cool?</h2>
<p>Though to this day, lots of dumb or bad people grow mustaches, they are still considered as extremely cool to billions of people worldwide. The lip broom is respected by men and loved by women. The mustache is by far the coolest facial hair, and for as long as humans walk the earth, the mustache will always be a staple and key tenant of human invention.</p>
